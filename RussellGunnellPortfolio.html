			<p>
				Hello! I am a currently a student of MS Coding Academies.
				<br/>
				I live in Starkville MS. And I am currently seeking oppurtunities for internships.
				<br/>
				You can find some of the various projects I have worked on down below. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>

				<header style="font-size: 24px;">Kiosk Project</header>
				<br/>
				<img src="images/KioskProject.jpg" alt="KioskProject not found." title="Kiosk Log Record"/>
				<br/>
				-The total cost of each item purchased is calculated.
				<br/>
				-The user can input individual bill/coin values until the full price is paid.
				<br/>
				-The user can also enter credit/debit card number instead
				<br/>
				-The program keeps an inventory of every bill and coin in the kiosk.
				<br/>
				-The user is refunded if the kiosk does not have the sufficient change required.
				<br/>
				-Another program starts when prompted by the current program.
				<br/>
				-The second program creates a TXT file named after the current date, or appends this file if it already exists.
				<br/>
				-Details of the transaction are listed within the TXT file.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				
				<header style="font-size: 24px;">Ascii Art Generator</header>
				<br/>
				<img src="images/AsciiArtGenerator.jpg" alt="AsciiArtGenerator not found." title="Ascii Art Sample" width=797 height=489/>
				<br/>
				-The program loads an image of the user's choice.
				<br/>
				-The image is assigned to a bitmap, where its pixel colors are converted to grayscale
				<br/>
				-The average grayscale value in a 5 by 10 area of pixels is calculated for every 5 by 10 space in the image.
				<br/>
				-The grayscale value from each average is converted into a pair of ascii characters.
				<br/>
				-The ascii characters are added to a string variable that eventually becomes the final product.
				<br/>
				-Line breaks are inserted into the string variable whenever the edge of the bitmap is detected.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				
				<header style="font-size: 24px;">Encoder Decoder Project</header>
				<br/>
				<img src="images/EncoderDecoderProject.jpg" alt="EncoderDecoderProject not found." title="Encoded Image Comparison" width=797 height=498/>
				<br/>
				-The Encoder program reads data from a PPM file of the user's choice. It can be a P3 or P6 type.
				<br/>
				-The A bitmap is created based on the size and color values in the PPM file, and it is displayed as an image.
				<br/>
				-A modified version of the previous bitmap is created with the user's desired message encoded inside as decimal values.
				<br/>
				-The modified bitmap is displayed as another image beneath the previous one.
				<br/>
				-The modified image is saved as a PPM file.
				<br/>
				-On the separate Decoder program, the user chooses a modified PPM file to decode.
				<br/>
				-The file is displayed as an image like before, and the encoded message is displayed to the user.
